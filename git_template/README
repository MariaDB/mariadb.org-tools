Commit notification e-mail
--------------------------

To configure commit notification e-mails for the first time, do the following:

- the following should be done regardless commit notification:
  = install git;
  = run git config --global user.name "<Your Name>"
  = run git config --global user.email "<your email>"
- clone/pull this tree (further it's location is <this tree>);
- create a folder <git templates>;
- symlink <this tree>/git_template/hooks to <git templates path>/hooks;
- configure git templates location globally:
  = for git versions >= 1.7.1, run 
    git config --global init.templatedir <git templates path>
  = for older git versions, set the environmemnt variable 
    GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR=<git templates path> 
    and make sure it is always set whenever you work with git;
- run git config --global hooks.postcommitrecipients "<comma-separated list of addresses to send emails to>;
- run git config --global hooks.postcommitbranches "<space-separated list of branches> (* wildcard is allowed)
- optionally:
  = run git config --global hooks.postcommitsender <e-mail to send notifications from> 
  = run git config --global hooks.postcommitmailer <path to mailer> 
    if anything other than /usr/sbin/sendmail is to be used
- make sure <this tree>/git_template/hooks/post-commit-email is executable;

Example (most common set of commands):

bzr branch lp:mariadb-tools 
mkdir $HOME/.git_template/
ln -s `pwd`/mariadb-tools/git_template/hooks $HOME/.git_template/hooks
git config --global init.templatedir $HOME/.git_template
git config --global hooks.postcommitrecipients "commits@mariadb.org"
git config --global hooks.postcommitbranches "*"

From now on, for all new clones of branches listed in hooks/postcommitbranches, 
commit notifications should be sent. 

If you had already cloned some trees before enabling commit notifications, 
you will need to amend those trees:

cd <cloned folder>
rm -rf .git/hooks
ln -s <this tree>/git_template/hooks .git/hooks


To disable commit notification(s), set SKIP_COMMIT_EMAIL environment variable 
to a non-empty value or set hooks.postcommitbranches to an empty value.


Notes:

- hooks/postcommitrecipients is a *comma-separated* list of e-mails. Normally, 
  it is expected to contain the commit mailing list, but you can add some other
  address(es) or change it if you wish;
- hooks/postcommitbranches is a *space-separated* list of branches affected 
  by the post-commit hook. Asterisk wildcard is allowed. 
  Please note that these are *real* git branches, as opposed to branch nicknames. 

Examples:

Assuming you did the following
  git clone https://github.com/MariaDB/server 10.1-mdev1234
  ...
  git branch
  # * 10.1
  git commit -a

 Example 1:
  postcommitbranches = 10.0 10.1 10.2
  # The commit e-mail will be sent because the current branch is 10.1, 
  # it's on the list

  Example 2:
  postcommitbranches = 10.0-* 10.1-* 10.2-*
  # The commit e-mail won't be sent because the current branch is 10.1, 
  # it does not match the pattern 10.1-*

  Example 3:
  postcommitbranches = 10*
  # The commit e-mail will be sent
