run_gdb
^^^^^^^
A wrapper that can run any executable under gdb.  useful for debugging mysqld
bootstrap (before mtr learned to do that) and to debug
mysql,mysqldump,mysqlbinlog,etc that are run from inside *.test files.

Use as

  run_gdb <path-to-executable>

it'll rename executable to <old-name>.exe and put a symlink to itself
under the old executable name. When run as this executable it'll
start gdb in xterm.

thou_shalt_not_kill.pm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A perl module that prevents killing of subprocesses. Useful to prevent
mysql-test-run from kill -9 your gdb session and from killing mysqld too
early, before it has finished the logging or whatever.

Use as

  perl -Mthou_shalt_not_kill ./mtr sometest

When mtr will try to kill something, you will see what it's trying to
kill and you'll be able to approve or cancel the killing action.

y.output-to-html
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Converts bison output file (from bison --verbose) to a huge html file,
that takes quite a while to load, but then one can navigate the grammar
with a comfort of a browser.

mtr-rejects
^^^^^^^^^^^

After running mysql-test-run.pl (particularly with --force), you can get many
*.reject files. Simply run this script from the mysql-test/ dir and it'll fire
gvimdiff for every reject file, you can review and merge changes as you like.
When you exit gvimdiff and .reject and .result file are still different, the
script will ask whether you want to overwrite .result with .reject (so you
don't need to merge all diffs in gvimdiff, but can simply answer 'y' later).

For many diffs with identical changes, where you mainly need review and full
overwrite (not chunk-by-chunk manual merging) run this script with --diff
option.  It will use diff instead of gvimdiff, saving you a few keypresses
per reject file.

It can also be run with the explicit list of reject files as arguments.

dbug-relative-times.pl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

when the trace is generated with i:T
replaces absolute timestamps with relative, since the last timestamp
of the same thread

mtr-log-pp
^^^^^^^^^^

Filters the 'typescript' (result of script -c './mtr --force') or
'text' ("save as" plain-text buildbot log of an mtr run) or any file specified
on the command-line (expected to be mtr output) as follows:

  test 'c1' w1 [ pass ]^M
  worker[2] - Restart^M
  test      w2 [ fail ]^M^G

becomes

  test,c1  w1 [ pass ]
  w2 - Restart
  test      w2 [ fail ]

That is, control characters are removed. One can grep for "w2" to
find all tests of the second worker and when it was restarted.
And one can easily copy-paste tests that were run (note "test,c1").
